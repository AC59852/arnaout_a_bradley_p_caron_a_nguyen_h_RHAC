# #NoShame
https://rhac-awareness.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
Thanks for checking us out, we're the people behind the #NoShame campaign!
<br>
Here you will find all of the files we used to create this site.

### What We're Doing
A digital marketing agency (Sagecomm) came to us with an idea that could change how people viewed stigma.
<br>
They wanted us to create a full scale campaign to create and grow awareness of what HIV/AIDS is
<br>
and how it is okay to admit or talk about it.
<br>
We created the #NoShame campaign, to show youth and young adults that it's okay to open up both online and offline,
<br>
since we can only end stigma together.
